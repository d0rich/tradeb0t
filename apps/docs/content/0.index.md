# tradeb0t ðŸ¤–

Tradebot is the small ecosystem for creating trading bots for exchanges. 

This project is used to be my diploma project, and you can check its orginal repository [here](https://github.com/badlabs/tradebot-core). Now I'm trying to make it more useful for other people.

## Main features

- **Standardized** - tradebot is based on [common domain description](/domain) for exchanges. It allows to create algorithms for different exchanges without changing them.
- **Scoped** - each tradebot instance is isolated from other instances. It allows to run multiple bots on the same machine.
- **Manageable** - tradebot have its own API based on [TRPC](https://trpc.io/). It allows to quickly create UI for managing bots.



## Demo

tradeb0t is built using mono-repository approach. It also contains several applications:
- [stubb0t](https://github.com/d0rich/tradeb0t/tree/master/apps/stubb0t) - stub implementation of tradeb0t for testing purposes
- [dashboard](https://github.com/d0rich/tradeb0t/tree/master/apps/dashboard) - dashboard for managing bots, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

### stubb0t

Stubb0t is deployed on render and available for usage: https://stubb0t.onrender.com/

It have no web interface, but you can use with TRPC client. For this purpose TRPC playground is available: https://stubb0t.onrender.com/trpc-playground. @tradeb0t/core provides it from the box in development mode. 

Try this query to get list of currencies in portfolio:

```ts
await trpc.currencies.listBalances.query()
export {}
```

Dashboard is full-stack application for managing bots. It connects privately to bots on server side and provides user-friendly interface for managing them.
Dashboard connected to stubb0t is deployed on render and available for usage: https://tradeb0t-dashboard.onrender.com/.

::alert{type="question"}
  Current implementetion of dashboard can't connect by WebSocket to stubb0t being deployed on render. I'm looking for solution. Howeever, real-time logs are available if you will run dashboard locally.
