# Architecture

The whole tradeb0t project is divided into several layers: 

- _Bot_ - the main layer, which is responsible for the bot's logic and the interaction with the user.
- _Algorithms_ - the layer responsible for the trade algorithms. It only provides interfaces, you should implement them in your own project.
- _Connector_ - the layer responsible for the interaction with the exchange. It only provides abstract classes, you should implement them in your own project.
- _Storage_ - the layer responsible for the data storage. Data is partially stored in memory, partially in the SQLite database file.
- _Domain_ - the layer responsible for the data model. It also provides utils for mapping data from the exchange to the tradeb0t domain. 

```plantuml

node Application {

[Bot]

frame Custom {
[Algorithms]
[Connector]
}

frame "Data Access" {
[Storage]
[Domain]
}

database SQLite

Storage --> SQLite : TypeORM
Bot --> Domain
Bot --> Storage
Bot --> Connector
Bot <--> Algorithms
