# tradeb0t dashboard

Dashboard is full-stack application for managing bots, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).. It connects privately to bots on server side and provides user-friendly interface for managing them.

## Demo

Dashboard connected to stubb0t is deployed on render and available for usage: https://tradeb0t-dashboard.onrender.com/.


> Current implementetion of dashboard can't connect by WebSocket to stubb0t being deployed on render. I'm looking for solution. Howeever, real-time logs are available if you will run dashboard locally.
